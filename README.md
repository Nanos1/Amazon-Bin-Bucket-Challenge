# Amazon-Bin-Bucket-Challenge

The Amazon bucket dataset contains over
500.000 images, labeled with the number of objects in each
image. In our project we test different models and find their
accuracy to predict the correct number of objects in an
image. After training many classical machine learning and
deep learning models, we conclude that the best results are
produced by the more complex deep learning models, and
particularly the Residual Neural Networks. Still, the accuracy
of the ResNet models is 50%, which shows the complexity of
this task and the poor quality of the dataset. All of our other
trained models could not achieve an accuracy higher than
(25%), which reveals how much more powerful the CNNs
are compared to classical approaches.
